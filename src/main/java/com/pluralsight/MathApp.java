1. Create two variables to represent the salary for Bob and Gary, name them
bobSalary and garySalary. Create a new variable named
highestSalary. Determine whose salary is greater using Math.max() and
store the answer in highestSalary. Set the initial salary variables to any
value
you want. Print the answer (i.e "The highest salary is â€¦")

2. Find and display the smallest of two variables named carPrice and
truckPrice. Set the variables to any value you want.

3. 4.
Find and display the area of a circle whose radius is 7.25
Find and display the square root a variable after it is set to 5.0

*
5. 6. 7.
Find and display the distance between the points (5, 10) and (85, 50)
Find and display the absolute (positive) value of a variable after it is set
to -3.8 com.pluralsight
Find and display a random number between 0 and 1
